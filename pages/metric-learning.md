## It is a general family of methods that learn distance functions from data. While much previous effort focused on learning **Mahalanobis distances**, recently the metric learning community has focused on learning [[Vector Embeddings]] to be used with standard (e.g. Euclidean) distance metrics.
### In this light, the problem of learning local feature descriptors is an instance of metric learning. For [[nearest-neighbour]] retrieval, optimization of ranking performance has been studied in metric learning.
## #Utility library
