#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Monocular 3D object detection methods can be roughly divided into two categories by the type of training data
#+END_QUOTE
### 1. uses complex features, such as [[instance segmentation]], vehicle shape prior and even depth map to select best proposals in multi-stage fusion module
#### 速度慢
#### need additional annotation work to train some standalone networks
### 2. employs 2D bounding box and properties of a 3D object as [[supervised]] data.
#### build a deep regression network to predict directly 3D information.
#### Then apply geometric constraints from 3D box vertexes to 2D box edges to refine or predict parameters.
##### 4 edges -> 4 constraints 太少
##### each vertex of a 3D bounding box might correspond to any edges
##### slight error in 2D box causes sharp decline in 3D prediction performance
