** Learning Feature Matching with Graph Neural Networks
** #topic [[graph network]] [[Descriptor Matching]] #attention
** Abstract
*** 能够同时进行特征匹配以及滤除外点的网络
*** matches two sets of local features by jointly finding correspondences and rejecting non-matchable points
*** 特征匹配是通过求解可微分最优化转移问题（ optimal transport problem）来解决
*** 损失函数由 [[graph network]] 来构建
**** use [[attention]] to solve an assignment optimization proglem
**** partial assignment (handle partial point visibility and occlusion)

*** acts as a *middle-end* between handcrafted or learned front-end and back-end
