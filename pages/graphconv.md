#### [[abstract]]:
##### In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful neural architecture to
###### learn vector representations of nodes and graphs
###### in a [[supervised]], end-to-end fashion.
##### The following work investigates GNNs from a theoretical point of view and relates them to the **1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman** _graph isomorphism heuristic_ (1-WL).
##### We show that ^^GNNs have the same expressiveness as the 1-WL in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphic (sub-)graphs^^.
###### Hence, both algorithms also have the same shortcomings.
##### Based on this, we propose a generalization of GNNs, so-called **k-dimensional GNNs** (k-GNNs), which can take higher-order graph structures at multiple scales into account. These higher-order structures play an essential role in the characterization of social networks and molecule graphs.
##### Our experimental evaluation conﬁrms our theoretical ﬁndings as well as conﬁrms that higher-order information is useful in the task of graph classiﬁcation and regression.
