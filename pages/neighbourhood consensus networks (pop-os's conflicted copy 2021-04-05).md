#### [[abstract]]
##### We address the problem of finding reliable **dense correspondences** between a pair of images.
###### This is a challenging task due to strong appearance differences between the corresponding scene elements and ambiguities generated by **repetitive patterns**.
##### The contributions of this work are threefold.
###### 1st, inspired by the classic idea of disambiguating feature matches using semi-local constraints, we develop an end-to-end trainable convolutional neural network architecture that identifies sets of spatially consistent matches by analyzing neighbourhood consensus patterns in the 4D space of all possible correspondences between a pair of images without the need for a global geometric model.
###### 2nd, we demonstrate that the model can be trained effectively from weak supervision in the form of matching and non-matching image pairs without the need for costly manual annotation of point to point correspondences.
###### 3rd, we show the proposed **neighbourhood consensus network** can be applied to a range of matching tasks including both **category- and instance-level matching**

## Strucutures
heading:: true
### Dense feature extraction and matching
#### Input Image $I$
#### output a dense set of descriptors $\{f_{ij}^I\}\in \mathbb{R}^d$
#### 传统的先hard assign matches 后进行Neighbourhood consensus的方法 不适合learning,2个原因
##### select a particular match is not differentiable w.r.t. the set of all possible features
##### for **repetitive** features
###### assign the match to the first nearest neighbor might result in wrong match
###### hard assignment will lose valuable information about the** subsequent closest neighbors**

### soft mutual nearest neighbour filter
### extraction of correspondences from the output 4D filtered match tensor
