### Keywords should be linked rather than isolation.
## 1. Writing is Thinking
### Distil the knowledge in your own words instead of just copying.
### 写作是最好的facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have.
### Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying. It is the **medium** of all this work.
## 2. An External System - as second brain
### [[Zettelkasten]] (a slip-box like note-taking system)
