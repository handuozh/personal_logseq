title: eigenvector

- #maths [[linear algebra]]
- an eigenvector of a [[linear transform]] is a nonzero vector that changes by [[eigenvalue]] when that linear transformation is applied to it.
- Geometrically, an eigenvector, corresponding to a real nonzero eigenvalue, points in a direction in which it is stretched by the transformation.
    - [[eigenvalue]] is the factor by which it is stretched.
    - negative eigenvalue means direction is reversed.
