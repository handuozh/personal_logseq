## #maths [[linear algebra]] 

## an eigenvector of a [[linear transform]] is a nonzero vector that changes by [[eigenvalue]] when that linear transformation is applied to it.
## Geometrically, an eigenvector, corresponding to a real nonzero eigenvalue, points in a direction in which it is stretched by the transformation.
### [[eigenvalue]] is the factor by which it is stretched.
### negative eigenvalue means direction is reversed.
