## Relative objective function for [[bundle adjustment]] 

## uses a **relative representation** for frame and point variables
### So global position of the frames must be recovered from the relative variables
### computation large
## No need for full reconstruction
### only on a manifold
## [[RBA]] is equivalent to [[BA]] if the network of relative constraints forms a [[tree]]
### works well on exploratory scenarios where no cycles within the [[active window]]
