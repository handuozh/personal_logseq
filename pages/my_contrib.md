## Unify global and local image features into one auto-encoder model to conduct image retrieval and keypoint extraction tasks.
### Motivation
#### With the recent advances in robotics navigation and visual SLAM, loop closure has been studied substantially. To address it in practice, both image retrieval and geometric verification tasks need to be accomplished.
#### Therefore, keypoint extraction and description is required not only for local adjacent image frames as visual odometry but also for the system to validate whether
#### However, the
