## Unify global and local image features into one auto-encoder model to conduct image retrieval and keypoint extraction tasks.
### With the recent advances in robotics navigation and visual SLAM, loop closure has been studied substantially. To address it in practice, both image retrieval and geometric verification tasks need to be conducted thus image feature extraction and description is required for the system to validate whether
### However, the
