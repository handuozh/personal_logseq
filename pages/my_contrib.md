## Unify global and local image features into one auto-encoder model to extract keypoints, descriptors and conduct their correspondence matching between two images.
### With the recent advances in robotics navigation and visual SLAM, loop closure has been studied substantially. To address it in practice, both image retrieval and geometric verification tasks need to be conducted thus image feature extraction and description is required.
### However, the
### Deep learning architecture
## Multiple sensor fusion
## Prior map saving
