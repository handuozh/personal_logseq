title: unify object keypoint tracking
---

- #related [[Working projects]]
- Background
    - Modern visual SLAM methods for dynamic environment
        - indirect ways
        - [[Dynamic Object Tracking in SLAM]]  #related
            - Feature tracking -> camera tracking
            - mask + camera tracking -> object tracking
            - Is object in motion -> output
        - Object detection
            - surrogate regression and classification on large set of
                - proposals [[Faster R-CNN]], [[cascade R-CNN]]
                - anchors [[focal loss]], [[YOLO]]
                - window centers [[Objects as points]]
            - Need postprocessing steps (NMS)
            -
- Ideas
    - Set prediction formulation (finite predictions)
    - No geometric priors (NMS, anchors, ...)
    - Fully differentiable
    - Competitive performance
- Novelty
    - [[query-key]]  schema for both [[MOT]]  and [[Descriptor-Matching]] of [[Keypoint]]s
