## EKF Linearized Error-State System
### When developing an extended Kalman filter ([[EKF]]), one needs to linearize the nonlinear motion and measurement models about some linearization point. This linearization is one of the sources of error causing inaccuracies in the estimates (in addition to, for exmaple, model errors and measurement noise). Let us consider the following linearized error-state visual-inertial system:
