title: normalized scene flow
---

- a vector pointing in the direction of the true 3D scene flow
- Can be "upgraded" from 2D flow $\tilde{\mathbf{u}}$ knowing motion-in-depth $\tau$ and camera intrinsics $\mathbf{K}$.
- When augmented with true depth of the point in either frame $Z$ or $Z^{\prime}$, normalized scene flow can be "upgraded" into the true 3D scene flow.
