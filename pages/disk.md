## Meta Data
### #title DISK: Learning local features with policy gradient, 2020
### #topic [[Reinforcement Learning]], [[Keypoint]]
## Abstract
### DISK for _DIScrete Keypoints_
### based on ^^discreteness^^ inherent to the selection and matching of sparse features.
### Probabilistic model
## Notion
### Given images $A$ and $B$, extract a set of local features $F_A$, $F_B$ and match to get a set of correspondences $M_{A\leftrightarrow B}$.
### $P(F_I|I,\theta_F)$ distribution over sets of $F_1$, cond. on feature detection params $\theta_F$.
### $P(M)
