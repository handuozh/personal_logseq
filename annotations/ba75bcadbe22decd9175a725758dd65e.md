### [[3D Object Detection]]
### For the detection task, we use the annotated bounding boxes and fit a Gaussian to the box, with center at the box centroid, and standard deviations proportional to the box size
### The goal for detection is then to predict this distribution with its peak representing the objectâ€™s center location.
### It also retains object identity across frames and ensures that the prediction is temporally consistent, reducing the jitter
#### Detection and Tracking refers to "it"
### we take the prediction and track it over time using the approach described in our previous blogs for instant motion tracking and Motion Stills. When a new prediction is made, we consolidate the detection result with the tracking result based on the area of overlap
